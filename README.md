# Weather App

## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge was to create a simple weather application that allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and a weather description, along with an appropriate weather icon.

## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data

### What I learned
During this project, I learned how to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API using JavaScript's `fetch` API to retrieve data asynchronously. I also practiced handling errors and displaying dynamic content based on user input and API responses. Additionally, I explored using CSS for styling and creating a responsive, user-friendly UI.

### Continued development
In future projects, I'd like to:
- Improve error handling to provide more specific feedback to users.
- Add additional weather details like wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, and forecast data.
- Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's city and display local weather information.

### Useful resources
- [OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api) - This helped me understand how to fetch weather data for any city.
- [MDN Web Docs - Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This was essential for learning how to work with asynchronous data in JavaScript.
